Customer Segmentation Project
This project applies clustering techniques (KMeans) to group customers based on behavior and spending patterns.
About This Project
I built this to refresh clustering concepts and practice working with customer behavioral data.
Added explanations and markdown notes to keep it natural and human-like.
Features
⦁	Synthetic customer dataset (500 rows)
⦁	Exploratory Data Analysis
⦁	KMeans clustering (simple, beginner-friendly)
⦁	Visualizations (can be added later)
⦁	Human-like notes & comments
More improvements might be added later.

Left with adding charts.
